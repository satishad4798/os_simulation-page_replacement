                         <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>The page replacement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process of replacement is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when the requested page is not found in the main memory (page fault).</p>

                    <p>When a page fault occurs, the operating system has to choose a page to remove from memory to make room for the page that
                          has to be brought in. The page replacement is done by swapping the required pages from backup storage to main memory
                           and vice-versa. If the page to be removed has been modified while in memory, it must be rewritten to the disk to
                            bring the disk copy up to date. If, however, the page has not been changed (e.g., it contains program text),
                            the disk copy is already up to date, so no rewrite is needed. The page to be read in just overwrites the page
                             being evicted. A page replacement algorithm is evaluated by running the particular algorithm on a string of
                             memory references and compute the page faults.Referenced string is a sequence of pages being referenced.
                              Page fault is not an error. Contrary to what their name might suggest, page faults are not errors and
                              are common and necessary to increase the amount of memory available to programs in any operating
                              system that utilizes virtual memory, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix.</p>

                              <p>Each operating system uses different page replacement algorithms. To select the particular algorithm,
                                    the algorithm with lowest page fault rate is considered. <br>
